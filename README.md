# Mental-Poker
Abstract: 
In this project, we explore the concept of playing Texas Hold ’em Poker without a trusted authority by using a decentralised Peer to Peer network model. We consider the applications of such a protocol in fighting internet censorship while avoiding funding corrupt casinos, and the resultant challenges involving the cryptographic protocol, the lack of trust in such a decentralised system and in the implementation of poker. The final product is a toolkit for peer to peer card games, with an implementation of Texas Hold ’em poker to demonstrate it’s functionality.
